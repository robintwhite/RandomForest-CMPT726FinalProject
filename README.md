FILES
=====
- TemplateDataSetPreprocessor.py - contains a template to follow for additional preprocessors to work with our random
                                   forest implementation.
- HockeyDataSetPreprocessor.py - contains logic to take the hockey dataset and extract it into training and test sets.
- RandomForest.py - contains logic for orchestrating learning and predicting with multiple trees.
- README.md - this read me file.
- runner.py - runs the random forests program.
- Tree.py - contains logic for a tree in the random forest.


System Requirements
===================
- must be run using Python 3.x
- numpy v 1.12.1
- pandas v 0.21.0
- sklearn v 0.19.1
- matplotlib v 2.1.0


How to Run
==========
python runner.py -d \<inputfile\> -c \<targetColumnName\> --use_hockey_preprocessor

or if you want to use a custom preprocessor:

python runner.py -d \<inputfile\> -c \<targetColumnName\> --use_custom_preprocessor \<preprocessorFileName\>


Please use the -h/--help option for additional details.

For Developers
==============
Please ensure that the pre-commit file in this repository is added as a Git hook for this project.

It will ensure that the runner.py script is run before making a commit, which will prevent people from breaking the this project.

To add the pre-commit hook, please do the following:
1. Ensure that you are in the mlclass-1777-randomforest directory.
2. Run: cp pre-commit .git/hooks -i

And you're done!


Compiling the report
==============
In case there is any trouble with the bib file, run pdfLatex + MakeIndex + BibTex to compile.
